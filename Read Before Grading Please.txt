I coded this in Python using pygame in visual studio code.

I had to move the directory to this specific folder for the source code to work.

The actual source code for the game is located in this directory and is called "Pong.py".

If you want the executable file its located in the following path (please don't move it or else it'll break):

"A08\executable_build\Pong.exe"
