# PONG
This is my take on the classic 'PONG!' game.

(Just a few quick things.)

If you just want the executable build, see the folder "Build".

If you want to edit this game, please ensure you have the "Pygame" library extension of Python installed.

(Also, your outfit looks amazing today!)

That is all!
